# sheep-counter
I have used two ultrasonic sensors which are connected to an Arduino Uno, which detect the number of sheeps inside the fenced area.

#The first sensor with t1 and e1 (trigger and echo pins respectively) detects sheeps which are entering through the gate.
#The second sensor with t2 and e2 (trigger and echo pins respectively) detects sheeps which are leaving through the gate.

#I have given 1000ms delay for the sheep to move through the two sensors.
